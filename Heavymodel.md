# Operational Model – Cloud Feature Delivery

## 📌 Overview
This model outlines how new cloud features — including customer capabilities, engineering enhancements, operational hygiene, and infrastructure upgrades — flow from product ideation to delivery execution.

---

## 📈 Workflow Structure

### 1. **Product Owners (POs)**
- Define and prioritize:
  - New cloud features
  - Customer capabilities
  - Engineering & operational enhancements
  - Cloud infrastructure upgrades
  - Hygiene activities

⬇️

### 2. **Chief Delivery Manager (CDM)**
- Central intake authority
- Aligns feature intake with delivery planning
- Assigns feature streams to delivery leads

⬇️

### 3. **Delivery Leads (DLs)**
- Responsible for:
  - End-to-end execution
  - Daily cadences and status tracking
- Manages Feature Teams

⬇️

### 4. **Feature Teams**
#### Composed of:
- **Cloud Principal Engineers**
  - Own architecture, design, and engineering standards
- **Delivery Engineers**
  - Build, test, deploy, and ensure operational readiness

---

## 🔁 Cadence & Communication Flow
- **Daily Standups**: Delivery Leads → CDM
- **Design Reviews**: Product Owners ↔ Principal Engineers
- **Engineering Syncs**: DLs ↔ Engineers

---

## 📎 Notes
- Model supports scalable and repeatable delivery across cloud capabilities.
- Encourages proactive hygiene and enhancement alongside feature delivery.
