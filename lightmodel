# Operational Model – Cloud Feature Delivery

## 📌 Overview
This model describes how cloud features — including customer capabilities, engineering and operational enhancements, hygiene, and infrastructure upgrades — are sourced, planned, and delivered through cross-functional PODs.

## 📈 Workflow Structure

### 1. **Business Technology Office (BTO)**
- Partners with Product Owners to:
  - Capture cloud feature requirements from business
  - Translate business needs into technical asks

⬇️

### 2. **Product Owners (POs)**
- Work with BTO to:
  - Refine and prioritize feature requirements
  - Create and maintain stories on **Jira Boards**
  - Align features with cloud strategy and platform roadmap

⬇️

### 3. **POD Teams (Pizza-Size Teams)**
Each POD is a small, cross-functional team composed of:
- **Cloud Principal Engineers**
  - Guide architecture and standards
  - Ensure technical feasibility
- **Delivery Engineers**
  - Build, test, deploy, and operate features

🔄 POD Responsibilities:
- Own a feature from design to production
- Collaborate daily using Agile ceremonies
- Deliver incremental value and iterate fast

---

## 🔁 Cadence & Communication Flow
- **Daily Standups**: Within PODs for sync and blockers  
- **Backlog Grooming**: POs + PODs using Jira  
- **Feature Planning**: BTO + POs  
- **Architecture Syncs**: Principal Engineers across PODs

---

## ✅ Key Benefits
- Tighter alignment between business and engineering  
- Feature ownership through full lifecycle  
- Agile and scalable delivery with minimal overhead
